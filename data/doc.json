{"title":"How do artists get paid from music streaming?","intro":{"p1":"It is commonly understood that artists make money when their music is being played on streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, Pandora, Tidal, YouTube Music, and Amazon Music. But most of us do not know how those payments actually work, which may sometimes lead to some misconceptions. For example, artists do not get a fixed rate for every stream, e.g. $0.00026 per stream<sup>1</sup>, or $0.0037 per stream<sup>2</sup>.","p2":"Instead, music recordings royalties are a share of the streaming platforms revenue that is proportional to their commercial use - i.e. when it gets listened to.","p3":"Let’s dive in and break down the fundamental principles that dictate how artists get paid from music streaming."},"sec1":{"headline":"Artist and Intermediaries","intro":"Let's start by examining who are the players involved in getting the artist's music online and making sure they receive the money they are due.","bloc1":{"headline":"Featuring artist recording royalties","p1":"A bit of clarification before we start. For every track on a streaming platform, a number of parties may be due a payment, such as the featuring artist, composer, lyricist, publisher, record label etc.","p2":"In order to keep things simple, this article focuses only on the case of the recording royalties due to the primary/featuring artist(s)."},"bloc2":{"headline":"Getting Music Online","p1":"First things first: before any music can be played on streaming platforms it has to get there.","p2":"Artists do not deal with streaming platforms directly. Instead, they use a distributor who will then take care of getting their music to streaming platforms.","p3":"In the case that the artist is signed to a record label, the record label may take care of the distribution on behalf of the artist."},"bloc3":{"headline":"Collecting Royalties","p1":"When music is streamed, royalties will be due to the right holders. The term “right holders” designates whoever owns the right to the recording. For example it can be the artist themselves if they are independent, or the record label if the artist is signed to one.","p2":"The distributor and/or label will then collect the corresponding royalties from the streaming platforms and pay those who are due to receive them (or a share thereof), such as the artist."}},"sec2":{"headline":"Where does the money come from?","intro":{"p1":"You may be wondering: Where does the royalties money come from in the first place? Essentially, the streaming platforms devote a share of their revenue to the payment of royalties.","p2":"Commercial offering may vary from one DSP to the next but there exists two main mechanisms for DSPs to generate revenue: \r\n\r\n\r\nSubscriptions.Users of the platform pay a monthly subscription to gain access to the music on the platform. This is also known as a \"Premium\" model. \r\n\r\n\r\nAds. Users do not pay any money but instead listen to and/or see ads while they use the platform. The advertisers pay the streaming platform for the exposure to their customers. This is also known as a \"Freemium\" model."},"bloc1":{"headline":"Spotify example","p1":"Let’s use Spotify’s financials for the third quarter (Q3) of 2020<sup>3</sup> as an example.","p2":"Spotify reports that premium and (active) freemium users represent about 45% and 55% of total users, respectively."},"bloc2":{"p1":"Subscriptions generated $1,790M while ads generated $185M.","p2":"This means that premium subscribers represent around 45% of Spotify users and generate about 90% of the total revenue, while the 55% of ad-supported users only generate about 10% of the revenue.","p3":"Looking at it from a different perspective: premium subscribers generate over 12 times more revenue than freemium users."}}}
